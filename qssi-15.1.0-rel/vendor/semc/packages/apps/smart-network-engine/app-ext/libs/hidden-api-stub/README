* How to create stub jar - tested on Android T environment

1. Prepare defs file if necessary (e.g. framework.defs under 'defs' directory)
2. Copy target jar file from build tree (file location is written in defs file)
3. Extract dex file from the jar with unzip tool
4. Convert dex to jar with dex2jar tool
     E.g. $ dex2jar/dex-tools-2.1/d2j-dex2jar.sh classes.dex
5. Combine all jar files if there are multiple dex files in one jar
6. Run './make-api-stub-jar.sh <jar> <defs>'
7. 'stub.jar' is now generated. Rename and move it to 'compile-only' directory
