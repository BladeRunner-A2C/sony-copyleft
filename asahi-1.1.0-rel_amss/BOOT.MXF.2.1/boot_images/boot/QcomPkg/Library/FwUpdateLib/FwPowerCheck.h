  Header for Battery power level checks for Firmware Update.

  Microsoft requirement is that system must have at least 50% battery life to
  as a pre-installation check to permit firmware update.

  Set ALLOW_NO_BATTERY_FIRMWARE_UPDATE to 1 to permit firmware update
  on devices that have no battery connected on Qualcomm reference hardware.
