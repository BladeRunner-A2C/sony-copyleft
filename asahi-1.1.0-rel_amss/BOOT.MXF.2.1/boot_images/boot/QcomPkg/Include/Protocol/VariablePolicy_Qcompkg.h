  Accepts a pointer to a policy entry structure and returns the status of

  policy structures are valid, the function will return EFI_SUCCESS. If the
  Variable Policy Engine is locked, RegisterVariablePolicy call will return
  EFI_WRITE_PROTECTED and will not register the policy entry.

  Upon successful registration of a policy entry, Variable Policy Engine will
  then evaluate this entry on subsequent variable access calls (as long as
  Variable Policy Engine hasn't been disabled).

  Wildcards are policies that:
   - Either do not specify a Name field in the policy entry. Therefore the policy
     targets the entire Namespace.
   - Or the Name field contains a '#' to denote a digit. If '#' wildcard is used,
     then Name must not contain any other digits.

  Order of precedence for matching variables to policy:
   - First check for non-wildcard policy match
   - Then match wildcard policy with all digits converted to '#'
   - Finally match wildcard policy targeting the Namespace

  @param PolicyEntry - pointer to a policy entry.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS               Successfully registered a policy entry.
  @retval EFI_WRITE_PROTECTED       Variable Policy Engine is locked.

                                      is already installed.
