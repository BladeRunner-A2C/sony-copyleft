/**
std_scanul()

Description:

  The std_scanul() converts an ASCII representation of a number
  to an unsigned long.  It expects strings that match the
  following pattern:

       spaces [+|-] digits


  'Spaces' is zero or more ASCII space or tab characters.

  'Digits' is any number of digits valid in the radix.  Letters
  'A' through 'Z' are treated as digits with values 10 through
  35. 'Digits' may begin with "0x" when a radix of 0 or 16 is
  specified.

  Upper and lower case letters can be used interchangeably.

  @param[in]  pchBuf    The start of the string to scan.

  @param[in]  nRadix    The numeric radix (or base) of the
                        number. Valid values are 2 through 36 or zero,
                        which implies auto-detection. Auto-detection
                        examines the digits field.  If it begins with
                        "0x", radix 16 is selected.  Otherwise, if it
                        begins with "0" radix 8 is selected.
                        Otherwise, radix 10 is selected.

  @param[out] ppchEnd   If ppchEnd is not NULL, *ppchEnd
                        points to the first character that did not
                        match the expected pattern shown above,
                        except on STD_BADPARAM and STD_OVERFLOW when
                        it is set to the start of the string.

  @param[out] pnError   If pnError is not NULL, *pnError
                        holds the error code, which is one of the
                        following:

        0            : Numeric value is from 0 to
                       MAX_UINT32.

        STD_NEGATIVE : The scanned value was negative and its absolute value was
                       from 1 to MAX_UINT32.  The result is the negated value
                       (cast to a uint32).

        STD_NODIGITS : No digits were found.  The result is zero.

        STD_OVERFLOW : The absolute value exceeded MAX_UINT32.  The result
                       is set to MAX_UINT32 and *ppchEnd is set to pchBuf.

        STD_BADPARAM : An improper value for nRadix was received.  The result
                       is set to zero, and *ppchEnd is set to pchBuf.

  @return
  The converted numeric result.

  None.
