/**
 * @file dbginfolib.h
 * @brief Definition of the debug info library API
 *
 * This header file provides the debug info library API for use by subsystems to
 * query system debug status. The APIs are divided into three classes:
 *
 *   - Basic system-wide debug status queries for such things as crash-dump settings
 *     and whether a debug policy was loaded that is serial-number bound.
 *
 *   - Subsystem debug option queries where the caller passes in a subsystem identifier,
 *     and the information is returned for *that* subsystem.  Such APIs can be utilized
 *     for use cases where the the caller knows which image it is calling from or where
 *     the debug status of other or multiple subsystems needs to be obtained.
 *
 *   - Subsystem debug option queries for the build-time-configured default subsystem.
 *     In this case the caller does not need to know what the underlying image is to
 *     make use of the API.
 *
 *  Additional background for this last class of APIs: There is a use-case for the debug
 *  info library API in the Q6 environment where it is difficult for the user of the API 
 *  to "know" which image the code is running on.  There was a request that we provide
 *  interfaces that are configured at build time (i.e. library compile time) to have
 *  a default subsystem set.  To be clear: this would be something that is set in the
 *  build environment when the API is ported for use with a particular image.
 *
