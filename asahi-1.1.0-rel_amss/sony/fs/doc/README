Prerequisites
-------------

Install Sphinx, and the PlantUML extension, using pip (or any other
preferred means of installation):

  $ pip install --user Sphinx
  $ pip install --user sphinxcontrib-plantuml
  $ pip install --user sphinx-rtd-theme

In order to generate PDF files, the 'texlive-full' Ubuntu package is
the easiest way to install the necessary tools:

  $ apt-get install texlive-full
  $ apt-get install graphviz

The PlantUML Java application, which can be used to embed UML diagrams
directly into documents, can be found at http://plantuml.com/. The
Sphinx configuration assumes that the 'plantuml' command can be found
in your $PATH. This can be achieved by downloading the plantuml.jar
file to some directory, and adding the following script named <plantuml>
somewhere in the $PATH (or in a new directory, which is later added to
$PATH in .bashrc):

  #!/bin/sh -e
  java -jar /path/to/plantuml.jar "$@"


Building output documents
-------------------------

To build PDF documents, the 'gen.sh' script can be used:

  $ ./gen.sh

This will create PDF files in the '_build/*/latex' subdirectories.
