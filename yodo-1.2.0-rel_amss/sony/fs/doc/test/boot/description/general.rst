This test framework aims to test the xboot library (Part of Flash Core Security GIT).
Besides verifying the implementation through the interfaces (fcs git: /boot/include), it
should also be possible to run the test system on multiple platforms, like Ubuntu and Target (UEFI),
with small changes.

Some test cases require a hardware state which can't be generated by the DUT itself,
which is why the system has to be divided into two parts which represent:

   * Host machine/ User
   * Device

The host is active during the whole test session (multiple test cases) and is reponsible for
starting the device in proper hardware state for the current test case.

The device is only active during the test case and will be shutdown/restarted between test cases.
