                    The History of PCCTS

         The Purdue Compiler-Construction Tool Set


                        Terence Parr
                 Parr Research Corporation
                   Minneapolis, Minnesota
                            and
                  University of Minnesota
      Army High Performance Computing Research Center

                      [Updated 8-7-94]


     The PCCTS project began as a parser-generator project for a  gra-
duate  course  at Purdue University in the Fall of 1988 taught by Hank
Dietz- translator-writing systems.  Under the  guidance  of  Professor
Dietz, the parser generator, ANTLR (originally called YUCC), continued
after the termination of the course and eventually became the  subject
of  Terence  Parr's Master's thesis.  Originally, lexical analysis was
performed via ALX which was soon replaced by Will Cohen's DLG  in  the
Fall  of  1989 (DFA-based lexical-analyzer generator, also an offshoot
of the graduate translation course).

     The alpha version of ANTLR was  totally  rewritten  resulting  in
1.00B.    Version   1.00B  was  released  via  an  internet  newsgroup
(comp.compilers) posting in February of 1990 and  quickly  gathered  a
large  following.  1.00B generated only LL(1) parsers, but allowed the
merged description of lexical and syntactic analysis.  It had rudimen-
tary  attribute  handling  similar  to that of YACC and did not incor-
porate rule parameters or return values; downward inheritance was very
awkward.   1.00B-generated  parsers  terminated  upon the first syntax
error.  Lexical classes (modes) were not allowed and DLG did not  have
an interactive mode.

     Upon starting his Ph.D. at Purdue in the Fall  of  1990,  Terence
Parr  began  the  second  total rewrite of ANTLR.  The method by which
grammars may be  practically  analyzed  to  generate  LL(k)  lookahead
information  was  discovered in August of 1990 just before his return.
Version 1.00 incorporated this algorithm and included the AST  mechan-
ism,  lexical  classes,  error  classes, and automatic error recovery;
code quality and portability were higher.  In February  of  1992  1.00
was  released  via  an  article in SIGPLAN Notices.  Peter Dahl, Ph.D.
candidate, and Professor Matt O'Keefe (both at the University of  Min-
nesota)  tested  this  version  extensively.  Dana Hoggatt (Micro Data
Base Systems, Inc.) came up with the idea of error  grouping  (strings
attached to non-terminals) and tested 1.00 heavily.

     Version 1.06 was released in  December  1992  and  represented  a
large  feature enhancement over 1.00.  For example, rudimentary seman-
tic predicates were  introduced,  error  messages  were  significantly
improved  for k>1 lookahead and ANTLR parsers could indicate that loo-
kahead fetches were  to  occur  only  when  necessary  for  the  parse



                                                                Page 1

                                                                 PCCTS


(normally,  the  lookahead "pipe" was constantly full).  Russell Quong
joined the project in the Spring of 1992 to aid in the semantic predi-
cate  design.   Beginning  and  advanced  tutorials  were  created and
released as well.  A makefile generator  was  included  that  sets  up
dependencies  and  such  correctly  for  ANTLR and DLG.  Very few 1.00
incompatibilities were introduced (1.00 was quite different from 1.00B
in some areas).

     1.10 was released on August 31, 1993 and incorporated bug  fixes,
a  few  feature enhancements and a major new capability - an arbitrary
lookahead operator (syntactic predicate), (alpha)?beta.  This  feature
was  co-designed with Professor Russell Quong also at Purdue.  To sup-
port infinite lookahead, a preprocessor flag, ZZINF_LOOK, was  created
that  forced the ANTLR() macro to tokenize all input prior to parsing.
Hence, at any moment, an action or predicate can see the entire  input
sentence.   The predicate mechanism of 1.06 was extended to allow mul-
tiple predicates to be hoisted; the syntactic context of  a  predicate
was also moved along with the predicate.

     In February of 1994, SORCERER (a  simple  tree-parser  generator)
was  released.  This tool allows the user to parse child-sibling trees
by specifying a grammar rather than building a recursive-descent  tree
walker  by  hand.   Work  towards a library of tree transformations is
underway.  Aaron Sawdey at The University of Minnesota became a second
author of SORCERER after the initial release.

     On April 1, 1994, PCCTS 1.20 was released.  This  was  the  first
version  to  actively  support C++ output.  It also included important
fixes regarding semantic predicates and (..)+ subrules.  This  version
also introduced token classes, the "not" operator, and token ranges.

     On June 19, 1994, SORCERER 1.00B9 was released.   Gary  Funck  of
Intrepid  Technology  joined the SORCERER team and provided very valu-
able suggestions regarding the "transform" mode of SORCERER.

     On August 8, 1994, PCCTS 1.21 was released.  It mainly cleaned up
the C++ output and included a number of bug fixes.

     From the 1.21 release forward, the maintenance and support of all
PCCTS  tools  will be primarily provided by Parr Research Corporation,
Minneapolis MN---an organization founded on the principles  of  excel-
lence in research and integrity in business; we are devoted to provid-
ing really cool software tools.  Please see file PCCTS.FUTURE for more
information.  All PCCTS tools currently in the public domain will con-
tinue to be in the public domain.

     Looking towards the future, a graphical user-interface is in  the
design  phase.   This  would  allow  users  to view the syntax diagram
representation of their grammars and would highlight  nondeterministic
productions.   Parsing can be traced graphically as well.  This system
will be built using a multiplatform window library.  We  also  antici-
pate  the  introduction  of  a  sophisticated error handling mechanism
called "parser exception handling" in a near future release.

                                                                 PCCTS


     Currently, PCCTS is used at over 1000 known academic, government,
and  commercial  sites in 37 countries.  Of course, the true number of
users is unknown due to the large number of ftp sites.

Notes on Building PCCTS 1.32 with Borland C++

I have gotten ANTLR and DLG to succesfully build with BCC 4.0, but have found
from experience that ANTLR, in particular, is likely to run out of memory
with grammars over a certain size, or with larger values for the -k and -ck
options.  Now that BCC 4.02 and the new Borland Power Pack for DOS is now
available, I feel that there is no excuse not to build these tools as
32-bit executables, as they ought to be.
 
For people without the Power Pack, the makefiles below should be fairly easily
modified to build 16-bit real-mode executables, but I don't really recommend
it.  As an alternative, you might consider the highly regarded DJGPP compiler
(a DOS port of the Gnu GCC compiler, with a DOS extender included).  Hopefully
some other PCCTS who has DJGPP can provode whatever advice is necessary.  The
Watcom compiler is also an excellent possibility (albeit a commercial one),
and I hope to make available Watcom makefiles in the near future.
 
Here are the makefiles I am using.  Both makefiles use a compiler configuration
file that contains compiler switches such as optimization settings.  I call
this file bor32.cfg and keep a copy in both the ANTLR and DLG subdirectories.

Portions of this software are derived from third-party works licensed
under terms compatible with the above MIT license:

The TRE regular expression implementation (src/regex/reg* and
src/regex/tre*) is Copyright © 2001-2008 Ville Laurikari and licensed
under a 2-clause BSD license (license text in the source files). The
included version has been heavily modified by Rich Felker in 2012, in
the interests of size, simplicity, and namespace cleanliness.

Much of the math library code (src/math/* and src/complex/*) is
Copyright © 1993,2004 Sun Microsystems or
Copyright © 2003-2011 David Schultz or
Copyright © 2003-2009 Steven G. Kargl or
Copyright © 2003-2009 Bruce D. Evans or
Copyright © 2008 Stephen L. Moshier or
Copyright © 2017-2018 Arm Limited
and labelled as such in comments in the individual source files. All
have been licensed under extremely permissive terms.

The ARM memcpy code (src/string/arm/memcpy.S) is Copyright © 2008
The Android Open Source Project and is licensed under a two-clause BSD
license. It was taken from Bionic libc, used on Android.

The AArch64 memcpy and memset code (src/string/aarch64/*) are
Copyright © 1999-2019, Arm Limited.

The implementation of DES for crypt (src/crypt/crypt_des.c) is
Copyright © 1994 David Burren. It is licensed under a BSD license.

The implementation of blowfish crypt (src/crypt/crypt_blowfish.c) was
originally written by Solar Designer and placed into the public
domain. The code also comes with a fallback permissive license for use
in jurisdictions that may not recognize the public domain.

The smoothsort implementation (src/stdlib/qsort.c) is Copyright © 2011
Valentin Ochs and is licensed under an MIT-style license.

The x86_64 port was written by Nicholas J. Kain and is licensed under
the standard MIT terms.

The mips and microblaze ports were originally written by Richard
Pennington for use in the ellcc project. The original code was adapted
by Rich Felker for build system and code conventions during upstream
integration. It is licensed under the standard MIT terms.

The mips64 port was contributed by Imagination Technologies and is
licensed under the standard MIT terms.

The powerpc port was also originally written by Richard Pennington,
and later supplemented and integrated by John Spencer. It is licensed
under the standard MIT terms.

All other files which have no copyright comments are original works
produced specifically for use as part of this library, written either
by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more
contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files
can be found in the git version control history of the project. The
omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the
interest of source tree size.

In addition, permission is hereby granted for all public header files
(include/* and arch/*/bits/*) and crt files intended to be linked into
applications (crt/*, ldso/dlstart.c, and arch/*/crt_arch.h) to omit
the copyright notice and permission notice otherwise required by the
license, and to use these files without any requirement of
attribution. These files include substantial contributions from:

Bobby Bingham
John Spencer
Nicholas J. Kain
Rich Felker
Richard Pennington
Stefan Kristiansson
Szabolcs Nagy

all of whom have explicitly granted such permission.

This file previously contained text expressing a belief that most of
the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently trivial not
to be subject to copyright, resulting in confusion over whether it
negated the permissions granted in the license. In the spirit of
permissive licensing, and of not having licensing issues being an
obstacle to adoption, that text has been removed.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
