This is a test application to create a tlcore on a 64-bit Linux machine.
kdump & kexec scripts need to be properly modified inorder to invoke this app.

Responsibilities :
=================
1. Dump kernel log from /var/tlcore/rdapp64/klog
2. Dump iomem.log from /var/tlcore/rdapp64/iomem.log
These paths are hardcoded in the code for ease of use. So before running this
app, create these two files in the paths shown above and then execute it.
3. It will read /proc/iomem and try to dump the sections into tlcore accordingly
